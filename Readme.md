For this project I analysed the AdventureWorksDW2019 Data Warehouse, 
and chose the Internet Sales "star" diagram for further analysis.
In SSAS I created calculated columns, measurements, hierarchies, and KPI's.
For visualization of the data I created a dashboard with visualizations in Excel,
importing the resulting data from SSAS.
